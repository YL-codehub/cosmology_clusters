Please have a look at Note_on_CEA_s_summer_internship_version_finale.pdf to understand the use of the different files.
Those files are only v0 and would need to be re-unified.
Cosmological_tools.py is imported in any of them.
Otherwise, each file is independent but often uses output files of others.
Most of the time, you have to uncomment the end of the file before running it.
